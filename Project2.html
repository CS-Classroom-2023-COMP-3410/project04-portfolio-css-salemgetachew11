            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The Python Pong Game is a recreation of the classic arcade game where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The goal is to defeat the opponent by being the first to reach a set score.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <p>This project was developed entirely in Python, utilizing the Pygame library to handle graphics rendering, event handling, and sound effects.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <p>Handling the physics of the ball's movement and collision detection with the paddles was challenging. I used mathematical formulas to calculate the ball's trajectory and implemented collision detection algorithms to ensure accurate interactions between the ball and paddles.</p>

            <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <p>Building this game helped me deepen my understanding of game development concepts, especially in the context of Python. I improved my skills in programming logic, physics handling, and using external libraries like Pygame.</p>
